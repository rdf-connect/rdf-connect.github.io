# Discover Existing Work

RDF-Connect empowers developers to build modular, reusable, and interoperable data processing pipelines.
Since its inception, many developers have contributed processors, runners, orchestrators, and complete pipelines across
various use cases and environments.
This means you don’t have to start from scratch — much of what you need may already exist.
On this page, you’ll be able to discover such existing components, ready to be reused and adapted to your own needs.
By leveraging the work of those who came before you, you can accelerate development, ensure consistency, and focus on
what makes your pipeline unique.

This discoverability is made possible through GitHub’s topic-based search.
By using standardized topics, it’s easy to find RDF-Connect-related components across the platform.
To support this, we encourage all developers to annotate their repositories with the topic `rdf-connect` for general
inclusion in the ecosystem.
Additionally, please use one or more of the following specific tags to classify your contribution: `rdfc-processor`,
`rdfc-runner`, `rdfc-orchestrator`, or `rdfc-pipeline`.
Consistent tagging not only increases visibility but also strengthens the discoverability and reusability of your work
for others in the community.
